### What we got from Group 5

-  We got the application with basic functionality to create short urls.
-  Functionality included was of updating, deleting and creating a short URL

## Goals
- Add login/signup functionality because currently the user has to remember the special code for each url - not possible.
- User should be able to manage his/her URLs - keeping intact the updating, deleting and creating a short url functionality
- UI needs to be revamped to greet the user, with a nav bar to enable to navigate to different pages
- A user should be able to analyse the usage of his/her links
- A user should be able to customise the small URLs
