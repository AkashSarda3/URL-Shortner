## URL-Shortner - Simple URL shortener

Hi! We are Group 16 and we bring to you the new URL Shortner. While Group 5 did a tremendous job starting with this project, we wanted to add new features to make it even better. 

We enhanced the UI and we enhanced the user experience!
We added a feature to login/sign up and create your own URLs! That's right now own those URLs guaranteeing management of your URL is safe and cannot be updated by anyone else.
We know why you use a URL shortner, you need to share links and you need to see how your customers are doing. We added some analytics to show how much your customers are using links!
Last but none of least, you do not want to use the boring URLs that URL Shortner gives you. We bring to you the custom URL feature!
You can create Custom Short URLs of your choice! Designed by you!
Your customers will surely love it!


Wondering why the Shortner is misspelled? That's because this project is all about making it short, simple, and easy to share.
URL-Shortner aims to be the easiest ad-free URL shortener that can be used to quickly generate sharable short urls.

- You ever typed out a long URL on your phone only to see that you missed a '/' or misspelled a word?

- Have you shared multiple URLs with others because you sent an incorrect URL earlier?

- You had to update the same document every year but with an updated URL, wondering if there was a way to keep the URL the same and just redirect to a new one every year?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, this will bring a smile to your face!
The URL-Shortner is a simple tool that you can utilize to create short versions of long URLs and share them with others. Additionally, it's just a few clicks to update an existing URL if you made a mistake or the URL has changed over time. If you don't need it anymore, delete it.
