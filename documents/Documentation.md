## **Getting Started**

## **How to Use**

**1\. Generate a Short URL**

* Visit yoururl.tech/url-shortner.  
* Enter the long URL and click **Get short URL** to receive a popup displaying the shortened URL and an access code. Save this access code for future updates or deletions, as it wonâ€™t be accessible later.

**2\. Bulk URL Upload**

* To manage multiple URLs at once, you have two options:  
  * **CSV Upload**: Upload a CSV file containing the long URLs you want to shorten, and the system will process each URL and generate short links.  
  * **Comma-Separated Text**: Enter multiple URLs in the text field separated by commas, and the shortener will process each URL.

**3\. Update an Existing URL**

* Click on **Update Existing URL** and enter the following:  
  * **Short URL stub**: This is the last part of your short URL (e.g., in `http://yoururl.tech/oe7p1SKtPS`, `oe7p1SKtPS` is the stub).  
  * **Access Code**: Use the code given at the time of creation.  
  * **Updated Long URL**: Enter the new destination URL.  
* Click **Update URL**, and if validated, your URL will be updated.

**4\. Delete a URL**

* To delete an existing URL, click **Delete Existing URL** and enter the access code. You can also delete all URLs at once from the table if needed.

**5\. Export Statistics**

* You can export link statistics at any time to save them locally. This feature allows you to back up valuable insights and use the data for further analysis.
